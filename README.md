Chatbot Development Exercise
This exercise involves creating a conversational chatbot that can answer weather-related questions and transcribe audio content. The bot can utilize various technologies, including OpenAI API, LangChain, Telegram API, and Whisper for transcription. Below are the instructions for setting up and running the chatbot.

Instructions
1. Setup
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies and credentials set up before running the chatbot. You may need to install specific libraries and obtain API keys.

bash
Copy code
chmod +x pre-install.sh
./pre-install.sh
2. Run the Chatbot
Run the chatbot using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python3 main.py
3. Interact with the Chatbot
The chatbot is capable of answering two types of questions:

Weather-related questions:
You can ask questions related to the current weather. Some examples of questions you can ask include:

"What is the weather like in Madrid tomorrow?"
"Is it warm in Berlin after tomorrow?"
"Is wind expected in London today?"
The chatbot should provide relevant weather information in response to these questions.

Transcription of Audio Content:
You can send an audio file and request the chatbot to transcribe its content. The chatbot should be able to transcribe the audio and provide a human-readable response.

Technologies
You can use any of the following technologies or any others you are proficient in:

OpenAI API (for generating responses)
LangChain (for handling conversation logic)
Telegram API (for chatbot interaction)
Whisper (for audio transcription)
Feel free to choose the technologies that best suit your skills and requirements for this project.

Please ensure that you have the necessary API keys and configurations for the technologies you plan to use.

Good luck with your chatbot development!
